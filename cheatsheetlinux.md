# Useful Linux shortcuts 

# Ctl + Alt + Backspace

    Use this shortcut when X isn't responding or a program has locked up your desktop and 
    you can't get anything to respond. This combination instantly logs you out of X, taking
    you back to the login screen. It works with all desktop environments and window managers.

# Ctrl + Alt + Delete

    This is the big kahuna. If all else fails and you just need to reboot, you can hit this 
    combination to instantly start the reboot process. All data will be lost, so use it wisely. 
    This combination works in all desktop environments and all window managers.

# Alt + Tab

    This handy shortcut allows you to cycle through all open windows, stopping on the window 
    you want to have focus. In other words, you don't have to grab your mouse and click (or 
    hover, depending upon your focus configuration) to give a window focus. To cycle through 
    the windows, hold down the Alt key and then press the Tab key until you land on the window 
    you want. This shortcut works in most desktop environments and window managers.

# Ctrl + Alt + F*
    
    This is one of those mack-daddy shortcuts you very well might need to use. It switches to 
    various virtual terminals. The default terminal you're working in is 6. So you can switch 
    to another terminal by holding down Ctrl + Alt and hitting F1, F2, F3, F4, F5, F7, etc. Now 
    these are virtual terminals, so if you already have a graphical interface going, you'll only 
    be able to work in a text-based terminal window. This is really good for debugging problems 
    with the desktop or killing frozen applications when you don't want to kill X completely.

# Alt + Arrow key

    If you're using Linux, you probably know about the pager that allows you to have multiple 
    desktops at one time. Instead of having to move your mouse to the edge of a screen, you can 
    hit Alt and either the left or right arrow key to move from one desktop to another. This 
    works in all desktop environments and window managers. 

# The following apply only to terminal (aka console) windows

# Ctrl + a and Ctrl + e

    If you are working in a text editor like Nano (from within a terminal window), you can get 
    to the beginning of a line with Ctrl + a and the end of a line with Ctrl + e. These do not 
    work in GUI applications. In a GUI application (such as OpenOffice), these combinations 
    will work as they would in a normal desktop world. (For example, Ctrl + a will highlight 
    all the text on a page.)

# Ctrl + c

    When you have a process running in a terminal window (say you're following a process with 
    the tail + f command), you can kill that process with the Ctrl + c combination.

# Ctrl + z

    This will zombie an application. If you have a process running in a terminal and you want 
    the terminal back but don't want to kill the application, you can hit Ctrl + z to send the 
    process to the background. To get the process back, type fg.

# Arrow up or Arrow down

    The up or down arrow key, when in a terminal window, cycles through the history of commands 
    you have issued in the terminal window. This is helpful for two reasons: You don't have to 
    retype commands all the time and you can more easily recall what commands have been run 
    recently.

# Ctrl + r
    This is a handy command search tool. When you hit Ctrl + r, you are prompted to enter a 
    character (or string of characters). You'll have returned to you any previously issued 
    command with that character or combination within. This is helpful because it does not 
    discriminate between commands and switches. So if you can only remember a switch you used, 
    you can enter that and the command will appear. When the command shows up you want, hit 
    Enter to execute.
