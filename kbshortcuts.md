# Ctrl + Alt + Delete
    
    Instantly start rebooting process. Be careful data will be lost, use it wisely. should works in all desktop 
    environments and all window managers.

# Alt + Tab

    Cycle through all open windows and stop on the window you want to focus on. To cycle through 
    the windows, hold down the Alt key and then press the Tab key until you land on the window 
    you want. works in most desktop environments and window managers.

# Ctrl + Alt + F*
    
    Switches to various virtual terminals. The default terminal you're working in is 6. So you 
    can switch to another terminal by holding down Ctrl + Alt and hitting F1, F2, F3, F4, F5, F7, etc.
    These are virtual terminals, so if you already have a graphical interface going, you'll only 
    be able to work in a text-based terminal window. This is really good for debugging problems 
    with the desktop or killing frozen applications when you don't want to kill X completely.

# Alt + Arrow key

    To move from one desktop to another. Works in all desktop environments and window managers. 

# The following apply only to terminal (aka console) windows

# Ctrl + a and Ctrl + e

    If you are working in a text editor like Nano (from within a terminal window), you can get 
    to the beginning of a line with Ctrl + a and the end of a line with Ctrl + e. These do not 
    work in GUI applications. In a GUI application (such as OpenOffice), these combinations 
    will work as they would in a normal desktop world. (For example, Ctrl + a will highlight 
    all the text on a page.)

# Ctrl + c

    When you have a process running in a terminal window (say you're following a process with 
    the tail + f command), you can kill that process with the Ctrl + c combination.

# Ctrl + z

    This will zombie an application. If you have a process running in a terminal and you want 
    the terminal back but don't want to kill the application, you can hit Ctrl + z to send the 
    process to the background. To get the process back, type fg.

# Arrow up or Arrow down

    The up or down arrow key, when in a terminal window, cycles through the history of commands 
    you have issued in the terminal window. This is helpful for two reasons: You don't have to 
    retype commands all the time and you can more easily recall what commands have been run 
    recently.

# Ctrl + r
    This is a handy command search tool. When you hit Ctrl + r, you are prompted to enter a 
    character (or string of characters). You'll have returned to you any previously issued 
    command with that character or combination within. This is helpful because it does not 
    discriminate between commands and switches. So if you can only remember a switch you used, 
    you can enter that and the command will appear. When the command shows up you want, hit 
    Enter to execute.
